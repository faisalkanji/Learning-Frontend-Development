# [jQuery](http://api.jquery.com/)
HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax

## Installation

### Download via NPM
1. npm install jquery
1. Require package

### CDN
1. <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

## Features

### AJAX
The functions and methods therein allow us to load data from the server without a browser page refresh.

### Attributes
These methods get and set DOM attributes of elements.

### CSS
These methods get and set CSS-related properties of elements.

### Dimensions
These methods are used to get and set the CSS dimensions for the various properties.

### Effects
The jQuery library provides several techniques for adding animation to a web page. These include simple, standard animations that are frequently used, and the ability to craft sophisticated custom effects.

### Events
These methods are used to register behaviors to take effect when the user interacts with the browser, and to further manipulate those registered behaviors.

### Forms
These methods and event handlers handle forms and their various elements.

### Minipulations
All of the methods in this section manipulate the DOM in some manner. A few of them simply change one of the attributes of an element (also listed in the Attributes category), while others set an element's style properties (also listed in the CSS category). Still others modify entire elements (or groups of elements) themselves—inserting, copying, removing, and so on. All of these methods are referred to as "setters," as they change the values of properties.
A few of these methods—such as .attr(), .html(), and .val()—also act as "getters," retrieving information from DOM elements for later use.

### Selectors + Traversing
Query offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document.
